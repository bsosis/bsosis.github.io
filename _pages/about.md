I'm a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh. My research focuses on mathematical neuroscience, building and analyzing models of decision-making and learning in the brain. I'm also very interested in AI safety, and recently spent a summer in London working on measuring the beliefs of language models through the [PIBBSS](https://pibbss.ai/) fellowship.

Outside of work I enjoy writing, playing, and listening to classical music, hiking, bouldering, and board games.
